Notes for self:

Uses `localhost:8090` in local development

`npm run deploy` -> updates dist/bundle.js

run `cp ../simple-tinder-app/dist/* .` from fresh-tinder-app on branch `gh-pages` (fresh-tinder-app is clone of simple-tinder-app on my local comp)

`git commit` & `git push` to get changes deployed
